## R version names ðŸ’»

R version names might be related with the sense of humor of whoever names the packages, but I wanted to discover how these names may be classified by the emotions. Dataset in this repo is firstly collected from [rversions](https://r-hub.github.io/rversions/) library on CRAN. Then emotions of the R version nicknames are classified with [Emotion English DistilRoBERTa-base](https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base) pre-trained model on Hugging FaceðŸ¤—.

## Emotion Classification with pre-trained model ðŸš€

Results of maximum values of each type of emotions regarding to the R-version nicknames and release dates:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
result %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  filter(value == max(value)) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```

As a result, R-version 3.5.0 that published in 2018-04-23 07:04:38 with the "Joy in Playing" nickname is the most joyful version name according to the model. ðŸŽ‰
